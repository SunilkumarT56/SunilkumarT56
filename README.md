ADK CLI (adk-cli)

ADK CLI is a lightweight command-tracking tool designed for developers who want to log and analyze their terminal usage.  
It captures every terminal command and sends it to a backend endpoint (AWS Lambda + Supabase Postgres) for analytics and storage.

⚠️ **Note:**  
ADK CLI is currently **under development** and available **only for macOS (zsh)** users.  
Windows and Linux support will be added soon.

## 🚀 Features (WIP)

- Tracks every terminal command you execute  
- Sends command metadata to your backend (Lambda / API)  
- Stores command logs in **Supabase Postgres**  
- Simple setup through `adk init`  
- Runs silently in the background  
- Developer-focused analytics pipeline  

More features coming soon.
